<h1 class="title">Logic</h1>

<p>Recall that AI problems are best designed and studied at the
&ldquo;knowledge level&rdquo; (see related <a href="./knowledge-level.html">lecture notes</a>). This is because AI
problems are knowledge problems (how to know what to do). Whether an
AI problem is solved primarily with array operations coded in Java or
list operations coded in Lisp is not highly relevant at the knowledge
level.
</p>
<p>
However, when we actually create systems that solve AI problems, we do
have to decide how everything is coded (assuming we are solving the
problem with software). There are at least two ways to represent
knowledge.

<p>
This is the form of knowledge with which you are probably most
familiar. Procedural knowledge is, essentially, a program. If you want
to give your robot knowledge about how to navigate a maze, you write
code to navigate a maze. This code will probably first find the
locations of nearby walls and exits, and make a choice about where to
move based on criteria embedded in the algorithm.
</p>
<p>
In another case, an industrial robot may be programmed to perform a
certain sequence of actions (maybe with a few variations depending on
context), such as assembling part of a car. The &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; is
embedded in the procedure (the algorithm).
</p>
<p>
Compare this description of procedural knowledge with the way
cognitive pyschologists describe procedural knowledge: they say that
procedural knowledge includes recognition of a face or reacting to a
joke. For them, it is &ldquo;tacit&rdquo; knowledge because it cannot be described
by the person who has it; exactly what knowledge is brought to bear is
not conscious to the agent. This is similar to our description because
knowledge that is embedded in an algorithm likewise is very difficult
to extract and explicate outside of its active use.
</p>
<p>
Note that our prior work with the 8-puzzle used procedural knowledge:
the board states were generated based on an algorithm; there was no
separate &ldquo;description of a board&rdquo; that we consulted.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Declarative knowledge</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p>
Knowledge that is explicitly represented separately of its use is
declarative knowledge. &ldquo;I declare that such-and-such is the case!&rdquo; It
is knowledge that is true independently of how it happens to be used
in some context.
</p>
<p>
Procedural knowledge is generally specific to the algorithm in which
it is embedded. Thus, there has been less of a drive to create
&ldquo;universal&rdquo; ways of representing procedural knowledge (well, perhaps
we can think of programming languages as universal representations of
procedural knowledge).
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, declarative knowledge, being essentially universal
in nature (not tied to a particular active context like procedural
knowledge is), has experienced centuries of formalization. If we want
to say something universal, perhaps we should have a universal way of
saying it!
</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;ll look at four ways of &ldquo;saying&rdquo; declarative knowledge, each more
sophisticated than the last. We&rsquo;ll explicitly note that these forms of
logic have nothing to do with programming (nothing to do with
procedures). However, in order to actually build software with
declarative knowledge, we&rsquo;ll next look at a programming language that
sort-of approximates a certain logical formalism.
