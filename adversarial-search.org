"It was a watershed event, but it doesn't have to do with computers
becoming intelligent," said Douglas Hofstadter, a professor of
computer science at Indiana University and author of several books
about human intelligence, including /GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach/, which won a
Pulitzer Prize in 1980, with its witty argument about the connecting
threads of intellect in various fields of expression. "They're just
overtaking humans in certain intellectual activities that we thought
required intelligence. My God, I used to think chess required
thought. Now, I realize it doesn't. It doesn't mean Kasparov isn't a
deep thinker, just that you can bypass deep thinking in playing chess,
the way you can fly without flapping your wings." --- Bruce Weber,
