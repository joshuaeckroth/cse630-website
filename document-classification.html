<h1 class="title">Document classification</h1>

<p>The goal is to take a new text document (an article from a website,
perhaps) and choose 1, 2, maybe more categories that describe the
document. These documents and categories relate to artificial
intelligence; the documents are obtained from searching the web with
terms like &ldquo;artificial intelligence,&rdquo; &ldquo;robot,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Turing test.&rdquo;
</p>
<p>
The 19 categories are: <a href="http://aaai.org/AITopics/AIOverview">AIOverview</a>, <a href="http://aaai.org/AITopics/Agents">Agents</a>, <a href="http://aaai.org/AITopics/Applications">Applications</a>,

These
links go to the AITopics website, which provides a news service called
<i>AI in the News</i> that must solve the problem of categorizing news
articles into one or more of these 19 categories.
</p>
<p>
These notes describe how to do the categorization; obtaining documents
and their content is beyond our scope. Thus, we will utilize a
prepared collection of documents. The zip files linked here provide
about 3000 documents with human-chosen categories. We&rsquo;ll take a
portion of these, say 90%, and train our categorization tools. The
remaining 10% will be used for testing purposes. Which 90% and 10% are
training and testing sets should be set randomly (and differently in
perhaps 5 or 10 different experiments to ensure a categorizer&rsquo;s
performance is robust).
</p>
<p>
<a href="./downloads/cse630-ai-articles.zip">Zip file of all AI articles</a> &mdash; these documents have the raw original text.
</p>
<p>
<a href="./downloads/cse630-ai-articles-stemmed.zip">Zip file of all AI articles (stemmed documents)</a> &mdash; these documents
are the same as above, but every word in the text has been &ldquo;stemmed&rdquo;
(see below). This is the document set we will be working with.

<h2 id="sec-1">Evaluation criteria</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Because each document may belong to more than one category, we cannot
just count how many categories chosen by our AI algorithm are true
categories (chosen by a human). This metric would not penalize cases
where false categories were chosen by the algorithm. We actually have
three cases:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>True positive (tp)</dt><dd>chosen categories that are true categories

</dd>
<dt>False positive (fp)</dt><dd>chosen categories that are not true
       categories

</dd>
<dt>False negatives (fn)</dt><dd>true categories that are not chosen
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
Since these measures depend on the number of categories (chosen and
true), and that differs per document, we calculate the following
normalized scores:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Precision</dt><dd>\(tp/(tp+fp)\) &mdash; higher precision means the
                 categories that were chosen were more often true
                 categories

</dd>
<dt>Recall</dt><dd>\(tp/(tp+fn)\) &mdash; higher recall means more of the true
              categories were chosen
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
We can achieve very high precision by only choosing categories for
which we have very high confidence (until we nearly choose no
categories at all); this would decrease recall, however. We can
achieve high recall by choosing every category; this would decrease
precision, however.
</p>
<p>
Best would be high precision and high recall. We can measure this by
combining precision and recall into a single formula, called the
&ldquo;F-score&rdquo;:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>F-score</dt><dd>\(2*precision*recall / (precision + recall)\)
</dd>
</dl>


<p>
Notice that precision and recall are treated equally in this
calcuation. Technically, the F-score is the harmonic mean of precision
and recall.

<h2 id="sec-2">Word stemming</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<blockquote>

<p>In linguistic morphology and information retrieval, stemming is the
process for reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their
stem, base or root form&mdash;generally a written word form. The stem need
not be identical to the morphological root of the word; it is usually
sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem
is not in itself a valid root.
</p>
<p>
[&hellip;]
</p>
<p>
A stemmer for English, for example, should identify the string &ldquo;cats&rdquo;
(and possibly &ldquo;catlike&rdquo;, &ldquo;catty&rdquo; etc.) as based on the root &ldquo;cat&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;stemmer&rdquo;, &ldquo;stemming&rdquo;, &ldquo;stemmed&rdquo; as based on &ldquo;stem&rdquo;. A stemming
algorithm reduces the words &ldquo;fishing&rdquo;, &ldquo;fished&rdquo;, &ldquo;fish&rdquo;, and &ldquo;fisher&rdquo;
to the root word, &ldquo;fish&rdquo;. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">Wikipedia</a>)

<h2 id="sec-4">tf-idf</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
The document vectors described above all suffer from over-scoring
common words. A common word like &ldquo;the&rdquo; does not give any evidence that
one document is closely related to another one just because they both
contain many instances of that word. So in addition to recording how
often a term appears in a document, we need to divide out some measure
of how common is the term across different documents. A term appearing
in nearly every document is not as relevant as a term appearing in
few. Additionally, if a rare term appears more often in a document, it
is even more indicative of the content of that document.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Motivation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">


<blockquote>

<p>Suppose we have a set of English text documents and wish to determine
which document is most relevant to the query &ldquo;the brown cow.&rdquo; A simple
way to start out is by eliminating documents that do not contain all
three words &ldquo;the&rdquo;, &ldquo;brown&rdquo;, and &ldquo;cow&rdquo;, but this still leaves many
documents. To further distinguish them, we might count the number of
times each term occurs in each document and sum them all together; the
number of times a term occurs in a document is called its term
frequency.
</p>
<p>
However, because the term &ldquo;the&rdquo; is so common, this will tend to
incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word &ldquo;the&rdquo;
more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful
terms &ldquo;brown&rdquo; and &ldquo;cow&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;the&rdquo; is not a good keyword to
distinguish relevant and non-relevant documents and terms, unlike the
less common words &ldquo;brown&rdquo; and &ldquo;cow&rdquo;. Hence an inverse document
frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms
that occur very frequently in the collection and increases the weight
of terms that occur rarely. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf">Wikipedia</a>)

<h3 id="sec-4-2">The math</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">


<p>
Every dimension (word) in the document vector has the following value:
</p>


$$x_{ji} = \log(tf_{ji} + 1) \log(n/df_j + 1),$$

<p>
where \(j\) is the index of a word, \(i\) is the index of a document,
\(x_{ji}\) is the value in position \(j\) (for word \(j\)) in the vector
representing document \(i\), \(tf_{ji}\) is the frequency (count) of the
term \(j\) in the document \(i\), \(n\) is the number of documents in the
database, and \(df_j\) is the number of documents in the database that
contain at least one occurrence of the term \(j\).

<p>
This graph shows the tf-idf value for a particular term in a document
that comes from a database of 1,010 documents. The bottom axis is \(df\)
(document frequency for that term); the top numbered axis (the &ldquo;depth&rdquo;
axis) is \(tf\) or (term frequency; the number of times that term
appears in the document under consideration); the right axis is the
tf-idf value.
</p>
<p>
We see in the graph that an uncommon term (\(df\) is low) produces a
higher tf-idf value. However, due to the use of logarithms, the tf-idf
value grows little as the term appears more often in the document. In
all, a term that&rsquo;s appears several times in the document and is
somewhat unique to the document is a strong indicator (of category
membership, of relevance to a query containing that term, etc.).

The above is a dot-product of two vectors. Because these vectors have

$$\cos \theta = \hat{X} \cdot X_j,$$

where \(0 \leq \theta \leq \pi/2\) and \(\theta\) is the angle (from the
origin) between the two document vectors in the higher-dimensional
space. More similar documents have a smaller angle between them,

absolutely no terms in common have a dot-product equal to 0.0, or

<h2 id="sec-6">Category centroids</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">


<p>
To construct the &ldquo;centroid&rdquo; (average, mean) of a category, we gather
up all the documents that are members of the category, and compute the
mean of their document vectors:
</p>


$$C_c = \frac{\sum_j X_j^c}{n_c},$$

<p>
where \(C_c\) is the centroid for category \(c\), \(X_j^c\) is a document
vector from the category \(c\), and \(n_c\) is the number of documents in
the category.
</p>
<p>
When we have a new test document that we want to classify, we compute
its distance from each category centroid. Then, we can either choose
to take the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; or &ldquo;most similar&rdquo; category, or the best \(n\)
categories, or all categories that have a distance less than some
threshold.

how many categories to select. We can use a threshold (choose all

centroid is greater than a threshold), or we can choose the best \(n\)
categories. The plot above shows performance for this second approach,
using various values for \(n\). For all such values, performance is
quite poor.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">


<ul>
<li>The centroids are computed ahead of time, and when we get a new
    document, we only need to compute its distance to a handful of
    category centroids (rather than compute its distance to every
    document in the database).

<h3 id="sec-6-2">Drawbacks of category centroids</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-2">


<ul>
<li>An averaged document vector may be distorted due to the presence
    of outliers (very bizarre documents that are members of the
    category). Perhaps some category outlier detector can remove these
    documents from the calculation of the mean.

</li>
<li>When using a dot-product technique, say \(A \cdot B\), if a vector
    \(B\) has more non-zero terms than another vector \(B'\) then the
    dot-product \(A \cdot B\) has a good chance of being greater than \(A
    \cdot B'\). This means that categories with more documents will
    produce centroids with more non-zero terms (because the documents
    in the category span more words than a category with fewer
    documents), and therefore, everything else being equal, larger
    dot-products. So the category with the most members will be chosen
    most often. (N.B., this is all conjecture; I have not verified
    this suspicion.)

<h2 id="sec-7">Support vector machines</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">


<p>
We will not be learning about support vector machines in this class;
the topic is too advanced. However, it should be noted that they
perform <i>very</i> well:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption></caption>
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="right" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col" class="left">Dataset (with tfidf)</th><th scope="col" class="right">Average F-score</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">ai</td><td class="right">0.925</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">la1</td><td class="right">0.950</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">oh10</td><td class="right">0.957</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">re0</td><td class="right">0.974</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">tr21</td><td class="right">0.953</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">wap</td><td class="right">0.981</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>


</div>

<p>
However, support vector machine training is very slow: training the
&ldquo;la1&rdquo; dataset (only 2883 documents and 6 categories) took 2.5 hours on
a quad-core machine (using all cores). Training with the naïve Bayes
method (described in <a href="./bayesian-methods.html">Bayesian methods</a> notes) takes only a few seconds.
