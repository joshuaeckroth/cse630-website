<h1 class="title">Uninformed search</h1>

<p>We learned in the <a href="./search.html">Search</a> lecture notes that search problems have the
following components: an initial state, possible actions, a transition
model that describes how actions change one state to another, a goal
criteria, and a way of calculating the cost of a sequence of actions
(a &ldquo;path&rdquo; cost). We do not use the path cost when executing uninformed
search.
</p>
<p>
The transition model defines a state space, which can be represented
as a directed graph (vertices are states, edges are actions).
</p>
<p>
For example, consider the 8-puzzle game, which requires that tokens
are shifted around until a particular goal state is reached.
</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<p><img src="./images/8puzzle-simple.png"  alt="./images/8puzzle-simple.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
Each &ldquo;state&rdquo; is a configuration of the puzzle. Each state can be
followed by at most four other states, resulting from moving a
neighboring token left, right, up, or down into the space (thus
shifting the space). If the space is on an edge or in a corner, fewer
than four movements are possible.

<h2 id="sec-1">Generic search algorithm</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">

<p>All searches essentially follow the same algorithm:
</p>



<pre class="example">1. create a list called "tocheck" of states to check
   - put the initial state in this list

2. loop:
   a. if the "tocheck" list is empty:
      - oh no! we have nothing left to check, and we never found a
        goal state! we'll have to quit with "no solution"

   b. otherwise, pull a state from the "tocheck" list, ensuring that
      we have not yet checked this state

      i. if this state is a goal state, we're done (return this state)

      ii. otherwise,
          - find the next states accessible from this state
          - put each next state in the "tocheck" list
          - repeat the loop
</pre>


<p>
We see that whenever the search algorithm discovers a state is not a
goal state, all accessible states are calculated and added to the
&ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list. This &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list typically grows quite
rapidly. However, rarely do we check every state in the &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo;
list. In fact, the different varieties of search differ almost only in
how they process this &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list, as we will see.
</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2">Random search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">

<p>A random search, while never practical as far as I know, is
nevertheless interesting to consider as a worst case search. To
program this search, modify step <code>2.b.</code> so that a <i>random</i> &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo;
state is chosen. Given enough time, the goal state should be found,
but a random search will probably take more time (more states are
checked) than any other method.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Breadth-first search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">

<p>In breadth-first search (BFS), we want to check all states (which we&rsquo;ll call
&ldquo;children states&rdquo;) accessible from the previous state (the &ldquo;parent
state&rdquo;) before we check states accessible from the children. So if
some state is to be checked, say state X, and there are 15 children of
state X, then we will check all of those 15 children before checking
any of their children.
</p>
<p>
Breadth-first search appears to search horizontally before searching
vertically.
</p>
<p>
To implement BFS, modify step <code>2.b.</code> to pick out of the &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list
the state that was added <i>first</i>. This means that earlier-discovered
states are checked first. For example, the children of the initial
state are checked before the their children, because the children of
the initial state are discovered earlier. The &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list in BFS is
essentially a queue.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of BFS operating on the 8-puzzle:

<p>
A trivial change to breadth-first search gives us depth-first search
(DFS). For DFS, modify step <code>2.b.</code> to pick out of the &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list
the state that was added <i>last</i>. So in DFS, the &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list is
essentially a stack. The purpose is to check the initial state&rsquo;s first
discovered child, and then that child&rsquo;s first child, etc. before
checking the initial state&rsquo;s second child. DFS appears to search
vertically before it searches horizontally.
</p>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-4-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-4-1">Iterative-deepening depth-first search</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">


<p>
Depending on the search problem, DFS may go off into
&ldquo;never-never-land,&rdquo; seemingly never arriving at a goal state, while
say, BFS, arrives at the solution rather quickly. We see this behavior
in the 8-puzzle problem because DFS just keeps trying moves that are
built off prior moves until it either repeats a state (somewhat
unlikely; there are 9! = 362,880 states) or finds the goal. If the
true goal is only five moves away from the initial state, then BFS
will find this goal in less than 1024 checks while DFS may require,
well, 362,880 checks.
</p>
<p>
To solve the problem of DFS going to &ldquo;deep&rdquo; into &ldquo;never-never-land,&rdquo;
we can put a limit on the depth of DFS. Step <code>2.b.ii.</code> is modified so
that only states that have depth less than some constant are added to
the &ldquo;tocheck&rdquo; list. The depth is calculated as the number of actions
that have been applied to the initial state.
</p>
<p>
Because it is often difficult to know what the correct depth limit is,
the <i>iterative-deepening depth-first search</i> (IDDFS if you like)
first tries DFS with depth limit 1; if no goal state is found, DFS is
run again with depth limit 2; and so on, until the goal state is
found.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5">Breadth-first versus depth-first search</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p>
Breadth-first search is a good choice when you want to evaluate every
possible choice before moving forward. BFS ensures that the shortest
path to the goal will be found (shortest in terms of number of moves
or number of &ldquo;hops&rdquo;), because no path is left unchecked. However, BFS
suffers when, at each state, there is an enormous number of choices to
consider.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, depth-first search seems a bit block-headed and
just pushes forward whenever it has a next possible move.
</p>
<p>
If we place a robot in a maze, a BFS robot would look around every
nearby corner before choosing to move forward. A DFS robot would move
forward as many times as it could (in any direction) before backing up
even once. If the maze can be solved by many possible paths, perhaps
the DFS robot is better.
</p>
<p>
But DFS is bad for the 8-puzzle game, because it is much more likely
that DFS will get further and further from the goal by making more and
more moves. BFS, on the other hand, is probably good for the 8-puzzle
game because there are at most only four possible moves and the goal
is often only a few moves away.
</p>
<p>
Also, it is important to note that if a robot is actually making these
moves, in the physical world (like driving a car), BFS is a bad
idea. BFS involves a lot of backtracking, so the robot would have to
turn around quite often. DFS, on the other hand, typically minimizes
backtracking.
