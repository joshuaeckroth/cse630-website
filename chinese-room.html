<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">The setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p>
Searle spends a moment describing a program by Schank that processes
stories. An example:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>A man went into a restaurant and ordered a hamburger. When the
hamburger arrived it was burned to a crisp, and the man stormed out of
the restaurant angrily, without paying for the hamburger or leaving a
tip.
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
If you are asked, &ldquo;Did the man eat the hamburger?&rdquo; what would you
answer?
</p>
<p>
Now suppose the story is:
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>A man went into a restaurant and ordered a hamburger; when the
hamburger came he was very pleased with it; and as he left the
restaurant he gave the waitress a large tip before paying his bill.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Again, did the man eat the hamburger?
</p>
<p>
Regardless of your answer (and its plausible qualifications, if you
are really thinking about this), I expect you can imagine what Schank
and Searle expect your answers to be.
</p>
<p>
Schank&rsquo;s program could answer these questions after &ldquo;reading&rdquo; those
stories. His program used a data structure called &ldquo;scripts&rdquo; that
indicated when a person goes to a restaurant, certain other things
usually happen. When the person eats his meal and pays for it, he is
happy with it; when he does not eat it, he is not happy with it, and
so on. A &ldquo;script&rdquo; is a scenario; some parts may be missing from the
story, but the script tells what those parts must be.
</p>
<p>
Now, Searle claims that Schank claims that the computer (running the
program) is not only simulating a human ability but also:
</p>
<ol>
<li>can literally be said to understand the story and provide the answers
     to questions, and

</li>
<li>that what the machine and its program do explains the human
     ability to understand the story and answer questions about it.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
Searle says both claims are unsupported by Schanks work (viz., the
program he wrote).
</p>
<p>
So, to prove this, Searle chooses to investigate what it would be like
for a mind to work like a theory of mind says it works. He sets up the
following scenario:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose I am locked in a room with a large book of Chinese
    writing.

</li>
<li>Suppose I know no Chinese, written or spoken, and I can&rsquo;t even
    reliably recognize it (as opposed to Japanese or bogus
    characters).

</li>
<li>Suppose I have another book of Chinese writing together with a set
    of rules for correlating the first book&rsquo;s entries with the second
    book&rsquo;s.

</li>
<li>Suppose these rules are in English (which I do understand).

</li>
<li>Suppose I am given a <i>third</i> book of Chinese, also with some
    instructions in English that enable me to correlate phrases from
    the third Chinese book with the first two books.

<ul>
<li>These rules tell me how to give back Chinese symbols/phrases in
      response to certain symbols given from the third book.

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Unknown to me, the people who are giving me all of these symbols
    call the first book the &ldquo;script,&rdquo; the second book the &ldquo;story,&rdquo; and
    the third book the &ldquo;questions.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>The symbols I give back are called the &ldquo;answers&rdquo; (again, unknown
      to me).

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>&ldquo;Just to complicate the story a little,&rdquo; suppose these people give
    me stories in English and ask me questions about those stories. I
    understand English, so I give back correct answers in English.

</li>
<li>Suppose the Chinese books are written so well that, <b>from an     outside observer</b>, my answers (in Chinese) to questions (posed in
    Chinese) to stories (written in Chinese) are correct and
    appropriate (like Schank&rsquo;s program).
</li>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Nobody looking at my answers can tell that I don&rsquo;t speak a word of Chinese.</b> My answers to Chinese questions and English questions look
just as good.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>But in the Chinese case, unlike the English case, I produce the
answers by manipulating uninterpreted formal symbols. As far as the
Chinese is concerned, I simply behave like a computer; I perform
computational operations on formally specified elements. For the
purposes of the Chinese, I am simply an instantiation of the computer
program.

<h3 id="sec-2-1">Does John Searle, therefore, understand Chinese?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">

<div id="outline-container-2-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2-2">Does this &ldquo;program&rdquo; explain human understanding?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">


<p>
No: the computer and program (Searle is the computer, the English
rules make up the program, the Chinese books are the data) operate
correctly but no part of them understands Chinese (Searle does not,
and of course a book does not &ldquo;understand&rdquo; anything, right?). So no
understanding is taking place, so this program cannot explain human
understanding.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In the Chinese case I have everything that artificial intelligence can
put into me by way of a program, and I understand nothing; in the
English case I understand everything, and there is so far no reason at
all to suppose that my understanding has anything to do with computer
programs, that is, with computational operations on purely formally
specified elements. As long as the program is defined in terms of
computational operations on purely formally defined elements, what the
example suggests is that these by themselves have no interesting
connection with understanding. They are certainly not sufficient
conditions, and not the slightest reason has been given to suppose
that they are necessary conditions or even that they make a
significant contribution to understanding.
</p>
<p>
[&hellip;]
</p>

<p>
Whatever purely formal principles you put into the computer, they will
not be sufficient for understanding, since a human will be able to
follow the formal principles without understanding anything. No reason
whatever has been offered to suppose that such principles are
necessary or even contributory, since no reason has been given to
suppose that when I understand English I am operating with any formal
program at all.
</p>

<p>
<b>What does Searle have in the case of answering English questions that he does not have in the case of answering Chinese questions?</b>
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The obvious answer is that I know what the former mean, while I
haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea what the latter mean. But in what does this
consist and why couldn&rsquo;t we give it to a machine, whatever it is?

<h3 id="sec-3-1">The &ldquo;systems&rdquo; reply</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">


<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;While it is true that the individual person who is locked in the room
does not understand the story, the fact is that he is merely part of a
whole system, and the system does understand the story. The person has
a large ledger in front of him in which are written the rules, he has
a lot of scratch paper and pencils for doing calculations, he has
&lsquo;data banks&rsquo; of sets of Chinese symbols.  Now, understanding is not
being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to
this whole system of which he is a part.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Searle&rsquo;s response (summed up): Let the human memorize everything. Even
get rid of the room. Then the system just is him, and he still doesn&rsquo;t
understand Chinese.
</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Actually I feel somewhat embarrassed to give even this answer to the
systems theory because the theory seems to me so implausible to start
with. The idea is that while a person doesn&rsquo;t understand Chinese,
somehow the conjunction of that person and bits of paper might
understand Chinese. It is not easy for me to imagine how someone who
was not in the grip of an ideology would find the idea at all
plausible.

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we wrote a different kind of program from Schank&rsquo;s
program. Suppose we put a computer inside a robot, and this computer
would not just take in formal symbols as input and give out formal
symbols as output, but rather would actually operate the robot in such
a way that the robot does something very much like perceiving,
walking, moving about, hammering nails, eating, drinking &mdash; anything
you like. The robot would, for example, have a television camera
attached to it that enabled it to &lsquo;see,&rsquo; it would have arms and legs
that enabled it to &lsquo;act,&rsquo; and all of this would be controlled by its
computer &lsquo;brain.&rsquo; Such a robot would, unlike Schank&rsquo;s computer, have
genuine understanding and other mental states.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Searle&rsquo;s response: Suppose, unknown to Searle, some of
those Chinese symbols are descriptions of images or sounds (from
cameras or microphones), and some are actions (move arm left,
etc.). Still, he need not understand any of that; the symbols look the
same to him.

<h3 id="sec-3-3">The &ldquo;brain simulator&rdquo; reply</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">


<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we design a program that doesn&rsquo;t represent information that
we have about the world, such as the information in Schank&rsquo;s scripts,
but simulates the actual sequence of neuron firings at the synapses of
the brain of a native Chinese speaker when he understands stories in
Chinese and gives answers to them. The machine takes in Chinese
stories and questions about them as input, it simulates the formal
structure of actual Chinese brains in processing these stories, and it
gives out Chinese answers as outputs. We can even imagine that the
machine operates, not with a single serial program, but with a whole
set of programs operating in parallel, in the manner that actual human
brains presumably operate when they process natural language. Now
surely in such a case we would have to say that the machine understood
the stories; and if we refuse to say that, wouldn&rsquo;t we also have to
deny that native Chinese speakers understood the stories? At the level
of the synapses, what would or could be different about the program of
the computer and the program of the Chinese brain?&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Searle&rsquo;s response: First, &ldquo;if we had to know how the brain
worked to do AI, we wouldn&rsquo;t do AI&rdquo; (I find that to be a curious
response&hellip;).
</p>
<p>
The main thrust of his argument is very interesting. Suppose the man
in the room is communicating via water pipes; his English rules tell
him how turn on or off various valves. The water connections
correspond to synapses in a Chinese speaker&rsquo;s brain. The whole system
is set up so that only after the right valves are turned on and off,
and the water comes out at the end in the right way, certain Chinese
symbols pop out.
</p>
<p>
This pipe system simulates a Chinese speaker&rsquo;s brain. Yet where is the
understanding? It&rsquo;s not in the valve operator who reads the English
rules (by assumption). It&rsquo;s not in the pipes (right?). It&rsquo;s not in the
&ldquo;whole system&rdquo; because the operator can just pretend to turn on and
off valves, the pipes are in his imagination, yet still he does not
understand Chinese (right?).

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;While each of the previous three replies might not be completely
convincing by itself as a refutation of the Chinese room
counterexample, if you take all three together they are collectively
much more convincing and even decisive. Imagine a robot with a
brain-shaped computer lodged in its cranial cavity, imagine the
computer programmed with all the synapses of a human brain, imagine
the whole behavior of the robot is indistinguishable from human
behavior, and now think of the whole thing as a unified system and not
just as a computer with inputs and outputs. Surely in such a case we
would have to ascribe intentionality (understanding) to the system.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
Searle&rsquo;s response: Sure, if such a robot existed (and
passed the total Turing test, etc.), we would ascribe understanding to
it, failing some reason not to. But we are just assuming this
understanding is there. If we knew how the robot really operated, we
would no longer say it understands.

<p>&ldquo;Your whole argument presupposes that AI is only about analogue and

technology. Whatever these causal processes are that you say are

that will be artificial intelligence. So your arguments are in no way
directed at the ability of artificial intelligence to produce and

<p>
Searle&rsquo;s response: The Chinese room argument attacks the claim of
strong AI that understanding only requires formal processes operating
on formal symbols. This &ldquo;many mansions&rdquo; reply redefines the claims of
strong AI, and those new claims are not what Searle is arguing about.

<h2 id="sec-4">The point</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<p>
What is Searle ultimately getting at?
</p>
<p>
<b>Formal operations that work on formal symbols do not exhibit understanding.</b> By &ldquo;formal operations&rdquo; we mean operations like &ldquo;flip
this bit from 0 to 1,&rdquo; &ldquo;sort this list,&rdquo; etc. Likewise, formal symbols
are equivalently shapes; &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &ldquo;1&rdquo; mean nothing, neither do &ldquo;x&rdquo; and
&ldquo;y&rdquo; or even &ldquo;Searle&rdquo; (the string of characters). They mean nothing to
a computer, that is. It does not matter what <i>we</i> think of these
symbols, they symbolize <i>nothing</i> as far as the computer is
concerned. Just to prove that point, we can take any computer program,
replace every mention of a variable named &ldquo;x&rdquo; with the name &ldquo;xx&rdquo; and
end up with the same program (assuming there did not previously exist
a variable named &ldquo;xx&rdquo;).

</div>

<p>
In linguistic terms, symbols are all syntax, with no semantics.
</p>
<p>
Any understanding or intentionality a program seems to have is just in
the minds of the programmers, and is <i>not</i> found in the computer that
is executing the program or the program code itself.
</p>
<p>
The same program can be &ldquo;executed&rdquo; using something other than a
computer. A child with a pencil and paper, or an elaborate
configuration of pulleys and stones, or water and pipes, etc. can
perform the same formal operations (given some energy source). The
first digital computers were &ldquo;programmed&rdquo; by plugging cables into
various slots; that is somewhat close to the metaphorical water pipe
system. Surely water and pipes do not understand what &ldquo;programs&rdquo; they
are &ldquo;executing&rdquo; (right?).
</p>
<p>
However, <b>real understanding</b> (a.k.a., mental states, or intentional
states) <b>is not purely formal</b>. Real understanding is <b>about</b>
something. When I believe it is raining, I am not just instantiating
some formal structure, but rather I <b>believe</b> it is truly <b>raining</b>,
like that wet stuff outside, falling from the sky. I can describe this
belief in any number of symbolic ways; none of those symbolic forms
are equivalent to the actual belief that I have.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, no formal system can have real mental states, real
beliefs about anything.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the claim of strong AI, that an appropriately programmed
computer is a &ldquo;mind,&rdquo; (i.e., has understanding), is false. AI may
still be fun and interesting to test hypotheses about how minds might
work, but no robot will have a mind of its own (so to speak). Thus,
the Turing test does not test for true
intelligence/understanding. Thus, the so-called Singularity is
impossible, etc.
</p>

<b>This is profound</b>, because the Church-Turing thesis (which cannot be
proven but seems inconceivable to deny), says that <b>any formal algorithm that we can completely describe in detail</b> can be programmed
and put on a computer (or calculated by hand or whatever). <b>Thus</b>, if
Searle is right, <b>there is no formal algorithm</b> for true mental
processes, for what we call the &ldquo;mind.&rdquo; The brain, being just that
physical mass, can be simulated, etc. But formal algorithms will never
produce a &ldquo;mind.&rdquo;

Is understanding an emergent property, just like ant societies are
emergent? Are we being too narrow-minded just looking at symbols and
individual programs? Perhaps the mind is a formal system but a very
vast system that has emergent properties which cannot be found in any
of the individual symbols or programs. (Marvin Minsky has a similar
viewpoint which he calls <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-868j-the-society-of-mind-spring-2007/">The Society of Mind</a>.)
</p>
<p>
Curiously, while we could replace every mention of a variable &ldquo;x&rdquo; with
a new name &ldquo;xx,&rdquo; which proves that what it is called (what it looks
like) makes no difference ultimately, we cannot do the same
replacement with an &ldquo;emergent&rdquo; system like a group of ants. If some
ants are replaced with larger ants, or slower ants, or ants without
mandibles (mouths), then the emergent behavior of the group will
radically change, even though all the ants still follow the same rules
(same program). How the ants look matters.
</p>
<p>
Is it the case that the emergent behavior of ants or emergent behavior
of a bunch of brain neurons cannot be completely described, and thus
coded in an algorithm? (This is essentially Smolensky&rsquo;s Subsymbolic
Hypothesis.)
</p>
<p>
If this is true, then Searle&rsquo;s argument falls flat. We can grant that
no single ant understands what it is doing; no single ant understands
Chinese (to overextend the metaphor). It&rsquo;s the collective, emergent
behavior that seems to have understanding, intentionality, beliefs,
goals, and all the rest. Right?
</p>
<p>
(The above argument essentially comes from Chalmers&rsquo; <a href="http://consc.net/papers/subsymbolic.pdf">&ldquo;Subsymbolic Computation and the Chinese Room&rdquo;</a> (PDF); <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar.bib?q=info:-1mhqsjgfWkJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=citation&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,36&amp;ct=citation&amp;cd=0">full cite</a>)
