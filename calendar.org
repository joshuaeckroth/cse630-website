** Homework 1
*** Due Sun April 1 11:59pm
*** Task 1
    Read "A Coffeehouse Conversation on the Turing Test"
    Answer some questions
*** Task 2
    Listen to the chatbots podcast
    Answer some questions
** Week 2
*** Uninformed search (April 2)
**** Why search?
     Can see many problems as a problem space, the best solution (or
     any solution) is somewhere in this space; we don't know where a
     priori, that's why we have a problem. Need some way to search
     that space.
**** Definining a search problem
     Initial state
     Possible actions
     Transition model
     Goal criteria
     Path cost
**** Visualizing search problems as a state-space
     Transition trees
     Transition graphs (revisited nodes)
**** Random search
     Truly uninformed
     Only works if search space is "random access"
     Examples that are: chess boards
     Examples that are not: routing (have to choose a destination that
     is accessible)
**** Breadth-first search
     Checking each action from one state before moving to the next
     state
**** Depth-first search
     Moving to the next state first
*** Informed search (April 4)
**** Heuristic functions
     Using knowledge to help choose a transition
**** Build up to A*
     Evaluating accumulated choice cost and next choice cost;
     revisiting old states that have more promise
**** Examples
     Route finding
     Tic-tac-toe
     Sudoku
**** "Game Over" part 1
*** Search exercise (April 6)
**** Practice with uninformed search
     Sudoku?
**** Practice with informed search
     Route-finding
**** "Game Over" part 2
** Homework 2
*** Due Sun April 8, 11:59pm
*** Task 1
    Define a search problem
*** Task 2
    By-hand, solve BFS, DFS, A* search problems
*** Task 3
    Code BFS or DFS, or (EC) code A* search (for some specified
    problem and heuristic)
** Week 3
*** Hill climbing, genetic algorithms (April 9)
**** Some problems have certain form...
**** Requirements to use hill climbing
**** How to use it
**** (Use GA to evolve ... what?)
*** Adversarial search (April 11)
    Tic-tac-toe
    Minimax
