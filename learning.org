#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The idea of a learning machine may appear paradoxical to some
readers. How can the rules of operation of the machine change? They
should describe completely how the machine will react, whatever its
history might be, whatever changes it might undergo. The rules are
quite time-invariant. This is quite true. The explanation of the
paradox is that the rules which get changed in the learning process
are of a rather less pretentious kind, claiming only an ephermal
validity. The reader may draw a parallel with the Constitution of the
United States. --- "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," Alan Turing
(1950)
