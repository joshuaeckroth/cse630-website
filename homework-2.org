* Task (100 pts)

  - The [[./search-practice.html][search practice]] example "Routing from Dreese Labs to Goodale
    Park" used road intersection distance to find the minimal-time
    route. However, this distance ("as the crow flies," i.e. distance
    not accounting for curved roads) is only one aspect of what makes
    one route better than another. What other information should we
    use to find the truly minimal-time route between these two
    locations?
